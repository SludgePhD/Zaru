//! Thread pipelining utilities.
//!
//! "Thread pipelining" is at the software level what CPU pipelining is at the hardware level â€“ a
//! processing pipeline can be split up and distributed across threads to improve throughput without
//! sacrificing much latency or introducing the typical multithreading-related issues.
//!
//! The written code is typically very close to single-threaded code, with channel transfers
//! inserted when threads are crossed.
